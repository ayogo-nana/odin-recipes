            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 Â½ cups unsweetened instant tea</li>
                    <li>1 cup nonfat dry milk powder</li>
                    <li>1 cup powdered non-dairy creamer</li>
                    <li>1 cup French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract (or vanilla bean powder for a dry mix)</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> In a large mixing bowl, mix together the white sugar, unsweetened instant tea, nonfat dry milk powder, plain powdered non-dairy creamer, and French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer. These ingredients form the base of your vanilla tea mix.</li>
                    <li> Incorporate the pure vanilla extract into the mixture. If you prefer a completely dry mix, use vanilla bean powder instead. This ingredient is key to giving your tea a rich and aromatic vanilla flavor.</li>
                    <li>Use a whisk or a spoon to mix all the ingredients thoroughly. Ensure the vanilla is evenly distributed throughout the mixture to achieve a consistent flavor in each serving.</li>
                    <li> For a smoother, finer texture, transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor. Pulse until it reaches a fine powder. This step is optional but recommended for a more refined tea experience.</li>
                    <li>Place the finished vanilla tea mix in an airtight container. Store it in a cool, dry place. This mix will stay fresh for several months.</li>
                    <li>To enjoy a cup of vanilla tea, stir 3 tablespoons of the mix into a cup of hot water. Adjust the quantity to suit your taste preferences.</li>
                    <li>Feel free to add a personal touch to your vanilla tea. Consider topping it with a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of honey for added sweetness and flavor.</li>
                </ol>
            
            <p>Indulge in the comforting and soothing flavors of your homemade vanilla tea, perfect for any time of day!</p>
