                <li>1 ½ cups unsweetened instant tea</li>
                <li>1 cup nonfat dry milk powder</li>
                <li>1 cup powdered non-dairy creamer</li>
                <li>1 cup French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>

            </ul>
        
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by combining the white sugar, unsweetened instant tea, nonfat dry milk powder, plain powdered non-dairy creamer, and French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer in a large mixing bowl. Stir these dry ingredients together until they are thoroughly mixed.</li>
                <li>Next, add the ground ginger, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground cardamom to the mixture. These spices are essential for giving your chai tea mix its signature warm and aromatic flavor.</li>
                <li>Using a whisk or a spoon, mix all the ingredients together until they are completely blended. Ensure that the spices are evenly distributed throughout the mix for a consistent flavor in every cup.</li>
                <li>For a finer texture, you can put the mixture in a blender or food processor. Pulse it until the mixture reaches a fine, powdery consistency. This step is optional but helps to ensure a smooth texture in your final drink.</li>
                <li>Transfer the chai tea mix into an airtight container. Store it in a cool, dry place. This mix can be kept for several months, making it a convenient option for a quick and easy hot beverage.</li>
                <li>To prepare a cup of chai latte, add 3 tablespoons of the chai tea mix to a cup of hot water. Stir well until the mix is completely dissolved. Adjust the amount of mix based on your taste preference.</li>
                <li>Feel free to customize your chai latte by adding whipped cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a dash of nutmeg on top for an extra special touch.</li>
            </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade chai tea mix, perfect for cozy evenings or as a delightful start to your day!</p>
